About 50,000 Iraqi security forces , Kurdish Peshmerga fighters , Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen , assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes , are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants . Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul 's eastern outskirts . The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces , says . Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities , since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities , having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles . However , IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site , says . IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base , 70km ( 43 miles ) south of Mosul . However , the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway , says , and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July . By comparison , Mosul airport 's destruction could be much more difficult to repair . Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah , IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport . says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities , the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport . Along with restoring the runways , Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars , warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base .

The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks . The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access , in order for users to remain anonymous .

Lead author of the research , Giacomo Persi Paoli , said : \" Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real . \" The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists , who can make virtually anonymous purchases , but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect . \" Guns account for less than 1 % of items sold on the platform , with its main trade being in narcotics .

This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers , the research team said . Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK . About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives . It mainly affects men over the age of 50 . The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments , which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens . But some prostate cancers do n't work that way . Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment . This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive , difficult-to-treat cancers . The latest research , published in the journal , found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors . Professor Paul Workman , study author and chief executive of the , said it was an exciting discovery . \" We call inhibitors ' network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once , across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway . \" These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein , and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance . \" said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive , drug-resistant prostate cancer . Prof Johann de Bono , a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the , said : \" These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer , and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options . \"", "\" This will give all total freedom to schedule their matches as they see fit ,\" said the group .

The team at looked at data involving 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers . It indicated : The argument is that if there is a higher rate of smoking before schizophrenia is diagnosed , then smoking is not simply a case of self-medication . Dr James MacCabe , from the at , said : \" It 's very difficult to establish causation [ with this style of study ] , what we 're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis , and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence . \" Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia , but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk . The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally , which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking .

The discoveries were made in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon . Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading , and Brazil 's S\u00c3 \u00a3 o Paulo , Bel\u00c3 \u00a9 m are also part of the team . Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical \" geoglyphs \" . The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood . They are unlikely to be villages , since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation , and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons . Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically , perhaps as ritual gathering places , similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America , or Britain 's own Stonehenge . Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world . He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation ; charcoal quantities , to assess the amount of ancient forest burning ; and carbon stable isotopes , to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past . \" The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation . So , unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America , they were likely not visible above the forest canopy , and this raises questions about their purpose ,\" he explained . It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century , the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems , free from human influence . But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years , which could only have been artificially brought together by humans . It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms . The team have likened it to a form of \" prehistoric supermarket \" of useful forest products . They said there is \" tantalizing evidence \" to suggest the biodiversity of some of 's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \" agroforestry \" practices to this day .", "Two of the songs come from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha , which was a Broadway smash in the 1960s . \" As far as I am concerned , Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know ,\" the Hobbit star said . \" Single handed , he is trying to change the world , regardless of any personal consequences .

Mr Steele said he spoke to her on the phone while she was in prison and she told him she wanted to move to a women 's prison that and her solicitors were waiting for her to make a formal application to the governor .

She did not have a Gender Recognition Certificate establishing her female identity so she was sent to a men 's prison . Coroner Jonathan Leach said the inquest would examine a number of issues including the suitability of the \" prison accommodation \" . The jury was told that after an extensive risk assessment process Miss Thompson was initially put in E-Wing rather than A-Wing , where vulnerable prisoners were housed , and placed on a one-hour suicide watch . Mr Leach said this decision was taken because it was thought she might be under more risk on A-Wing due to the number of sex offenders there . He said she was later allowed to move to A-Wing but was taunted by men in the segregation block below .

A year ago , the number of personal insolvencies in Scotland fell to its lowest level for more than 14 years following the introduction of the ( Scotland ) Act . The legislation introduced new measures such as mandatory money advice for people seeking access to statutory debt relief solutions such as sequestration . Although the latest bankruptcy figures were sharply up on a year ago , they were 41.7 % lower than the same quarter in 2013-14 and 34.9 % lower than in 2014-15 .

Amara arrived in Norwich from West Africa a fortnight ago and was turned down by two landlords - one by letter .

He told that he was \" devastated to be turned down \" . The letter said : \" Under normal circumstance . Your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers . \" However , given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic , we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the ebola outbreak within the last two months , or is likely to visit those areas in the near future . \" Amara , 35 , told that it is wrong to assume all people from Sierra Leone carry the disease . He says : \" It 's very unreasonable . And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected , then that 's just completely unfair . \" The good news for Amara is that after a few weeks of looking , he 's found somewhere to stay so he can continue his studies .

People arriving from the worst-affected countries will be questioned and may have their temperatures taken . Professor Tom Solomon is an expert on diseases like Ebola and how they spread . How worried should we be here in the UK ? I think we should be worried about Ebola in West Africa because sadly the cases have gone up and up but the situation in the UK is very different from the situation in West Africa . Was the landlord right to be so cautious ? I understand why people are concerned about Ebola but what people need to do is look at the facts and then make sensible decisions . You 're not going to get Ebola from renting your flat to someone from Sierra Leone . How do people get Ebola ? Ebola is passed on if someone is in contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actually sick with the disease . So clearly letting out your property wont put people at risk . Is the virus going to become airborne ? There is no evidence that the virus is airborne and we have never seen the virus change and become airborne - so there is no evidence to say that this will happen here .

UK summer sunshine is n't desperately strong . We do n't have many days in the year when it is very intense . \" What 's changed is that we 're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun , without suncream , several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer . \" Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five .

More than 70 % of people in the UK nationally say they like wind farms , according to a government survey . However , proximity often provokes a different response and the wind farms are frequently considered a blot on the landscape . The government previously insisted that wind farm developers should give local communities \u00c2 \u00a3 5,000 a year for every megawatt of energy installed - to support local initiatives . The taskforce goes further by insisting that any new applications entering the planning system must offer to sell part of their business to locals - somewhere between 5 and 25 % . This can be in the form of directly-owned shares , crowd-funding or debentures . Nina Skorupska , Chief Executive , welcomes the plan . She told : \" Elsewhere in Europe this is commonplace , so we 're very pleased the UK is also working towards this vision of a more open energy market . \" The scheme has been promoted by the Secretary , Edward Davey . He said : \" Community energy is revolutionising renewable energy development in the UK , and shared ownership will offer people the opportunity to buy in to the green energy that their own communities are producing . \" The and an associate of , Rebecca Willis , said : \" We know from our experience at grass roots level that there 's a substantial appetite among local communities to invest in renewable energy . \" There are , though , still likely to be areas where local people will prefer to keep their uninterrupted view than to cash in a regular dividend cheque .

Prof Peter Field , a renowned expert in Arthurian literature , said : \" It was quite by chance . I was looking at some maps , and suddenly all the ducks lined up . \" I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery . \" Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport , Somerset 's Cadbury Castle , and Tintagel in Cornwall . In Roman times , Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum , which means \" the fort of the god Camul \" .

Though almost forgotten and insignificant today , and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D . 500 , Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold . At that time , Celtic-speaking Britons , who could have been led by King Arthur , held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons . Slack , on the Roman road from Chester to York , would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast .

Australia 's economy has been adjusting to a post mining-boom landscape . It saw its economy grow 0.5 % in the October to December 2014 period from the quarter before , when growth was 0.4 % . On Tuesday , the country 's central bank , the ( ) , did not cut its lending rates further to help boost the economy , despite pressure from businesses to do so . The decision saw Australian stocks fall 1.72 % as investors saw little hope of a further cut in the near future .

In May , the cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to an all-time low of 2 % . Rising property prices in Australia 's biggest city , Sydney , a strong currency and a drop in iron ore prices were among the reasons for the cut . The May rate cut was the second this year , following a previous 25 basis point cut in February and followed similar action from central banks in China , Canada , Singapore , Korea and India . A rising Australian dollar had also been cause for concern , particularly for Australia 's big mining and energy exporters . Mr Oliver said more help would likely to be required \" in the form of an even lower Australian dollar - and to ensure this happens the may yet still have to cut interest rates further into record low territory . \"", "But the summer visitor is in decline and , according to a new study , its migratory habits may be to blame . Scientists have tagged birds leaving the UK and believe they take two different routes on their journey to spend the winter in Africa . Surprisingly , survival is lower on the shorter route via Spain , they report in the journal , . And this suggests that migration - as well as other factors such as loss of farmland and insect food - may be to blame for the cuckoo 's decline . More than half of cuckoos in the UK have been lost over the past 20 years , according to the ( ) in Norfolk , which led the research . \" That pattern of starting in the same place but taking two very different routes to get there has not been seen before in any birds , to the best of our knowledge ,\" said lead researcher Dr Chris Hewson . \" We need to understand the full annual cycle of a migratory bird in order to understand its population decline . \" Facts about the common cuckoo Source : / / BTO Since 2011 , the has been satellite-tracking cuckoos to study their migration patterns when they leave the UK . Working with the , the charitable research institute used satellite tags to track 42 male common cuckoos from the UK population during more than 50 autumn migrations . The researchers found that birds from declining populations were more likely to migrate to winter breeding grounds in central Africa along a western route ( through Spain ) than along an eastern route ( via Italy and the Balkans ) . The higher mortality occurred before reaching the harsh environment of the Sahara desert , despite the fact that the western route is about a tenth shorter at this point . The scientists think birds may have encountered challenging drought conditions in Spain . Alternatively , they may have been deprived of insect food such as hairy caterpillars before leaving the UK , leaving them with lower fat stores for their hazardous journey . Migratory bird species are increasingly threatened around the world due to factors including climate change , habitat change and habitat loss . Migratory birds ' lack world protection ' Understanding where mortality occurs during their annual cycles is therefore increasingly important , especially for long-distance migratory land birds , which show some of the steepest population declines , say the scientists .

Many of the company 's original buildings were demolished when the larger factory was built to meet the firm 's production needs in Lenton in the 1970s . \" Players relocated because they could n't build anymore in Radford as there was so much housing and that 's why there 's been a slow erosion of these buildings . \" The firm 's advertising later took off through slogans such as \" Player 's Please \" , which was registered in 1924 .

Researchers replicated the study in a group of 1,731 people from the Netherlands . The result was similar but the effect of the gene on the number of cups of coffee consumed was slightly lower .

The deeply revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October , plunging Thailand into mourning . The prince was widely expected to succeed his father , but officials had earlier said he wanted to postpone it by at least a year . The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king . Correspondents say Thailand was left in an odd constitutional limbo as the prince , the undisputed heir , should have succeeded his father immediately . In the past doubts have been expressed by senior officials over how the crown prince can perform the role played by his father for 70 years .

King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been seen as a unifying figure amid periods of political unrest , including during the most recent military coup in 2014 . The leader of Thailand 's parliament , the , is expected to meet the crown prince in the next few days to formally invite him . Once the crown prince accepts , his succession would then be announced to the public . But it is still not clear when that will happen . Former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda is currently standing in as regent . Thailand has rarely had what might be called routine royal successions . The last was 70 years ago , when the young King Ananda was found shot dead in his bedroom in still unexplained circumstances . When he died , an emergency session of parliament that night named his grief-stricken brother Bhumibol king . Despite private speculation over the prospects of his popular sister Princess Sirindhorn , Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has been the undisputed heir to the throne since his formal investiture in 1972 . Thai succession law follows the principle of primogeniture , where the throne should pass to the eldest son of the reigning king , but it also gives the king the discretion to name his own choice . King Bhumibol never wavered in his endorsement of the crown prince . But the crown prince 's unexpected decision to delay taking the throne has made this yet another succession which has departed from the script . His real reasons are not known ; public mourning for his father would not have been affected had he been anointed immediately after his father 's death .", "The East Antrim MP had been considering putting his name forward after Nigel Dodds ruled himself out .

By The 2014 Sochi Olympics were billed as a way of boosting the economy by bringing tourism to Abkhazia or sourcing materials for construction , but the most noticeable effect was actually a source of frustration : the expanded security cordon that penetrated beyond the Russia-Abkhazia border .

Raul Khadzhimba defended the protests , saying : \" Over all the years of his rule the president did not allow anybody in his circle to do their work . \" He took upon himself everybody 's responsibilities on their behalf , whether he should or should not have been doing this .
